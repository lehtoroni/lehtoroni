## üçê Hello, world!

Hi there! I am **Roni Lehto**, also known by the nickname 'Tapsa'.

I am a freelancer developer, mostly working with web based projects (...and occasionally some voxel-based games...)

### üìç Highlights
My main project for over two years has been [L'Math](https://lehtodigital.fi/lmath/), the free math editor for Finnish upper secondary students, originally based on the [Digabi Rich Text Editor](https://github.com/digabi/rich-text-editor/).

Since many of the projects that I'm working on are private, you won't find many interesting repositories on my Github. So, here is a list of links to my other online presences:
- [lehtodigital.fi - Personal website (Finnish)](https://lehtodigital.fi/)
- [projektit.lehtodigital.fi - Project list (Finnish)](https://projektit.lehtodigital.fi/)
- [xenomc.fi - A Minecraft server (Finnish)](https://xenomc.fi/)
