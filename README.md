## üçê Hello, world!

Hi there! I am **Roni Lehto**, also known by the nickname 'Tapsa'.

I am a freelancer developer, mostly working with web based projects (...and occasionally enjoying some Java with *a certain voxel-based game*). The languages I "get along with" include Java, JavaScript (both Node.js and browser) and PHP, not to forget Python and Lua for some specific cases.
